This breaks the styling of third party HTML code, such as HTML editors, loaded inside the component. Disable this if your HTML editor looks broken or you want to make template overrides using a different CSS framework, such as Bootstrap. If you don't understand what any of that means just choose 'Both' (the default option)."
