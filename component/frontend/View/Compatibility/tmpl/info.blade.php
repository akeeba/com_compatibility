        do matter. 5.3.28 is greater than than 5.3.4. For more information please consult our

        <strong>Support policy</strong>: Please note that only the latest released stable version of each of our
        software is fully supported at any given time. Only specific platforms (Joomla! / WordPress and PHP versions)
        are supported for each release. No support can be provided for running our software on unsupported platforms or
        problems arising from doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Legend</strong>: Versions in green background are currently supported on the indicated Joomla! /
        WordPress and PHP version and receive full support. Versions in yellow background are still supported but we
        recommend that you upgrade to a newer PHP and CMS version as soon as possible.
        Other versions receive very limited support about using
        them, but bug or security fixes are not guaranteed for them. You are strongly advised to migrate your sites away
        from these Joomla / WordPress / PHP versions as soon as possible. A dash means that there is no tested version
        for this PHP and Joomla! / WordPress version combination. All versions listed here are available from our site's
        <a href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/download.html">download page</a>. Alternatively, click on a version number
        to go to its download page.
    </p>

    <h4>Important note on PHP versions</h4>

    <p>
        We strongly recommend using PHP 5.6 or 7.0. We may drop support for earlier, end of life, versions of PHP
        without prior notice at any time. Any PHP version older than a couple of months can be assumed out of date
        and vulnerable to security flaws <em>even if your Linux distribution claims to backport security fixes</em> 
        because they will <em>only</em> backport those marked as high impact, not <em>all</em> security fixes. On top of
        that, PHP bugs which can cause the software you are using &ndash; both ours and the CMS / platform (e.g. Joomla!,
        WordPress, etc) &ndash; to work erratically are NOT fixed in older versions of PHP provided by Linux
        distributions.
