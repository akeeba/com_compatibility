        <strong>Remember!</strong> Version numbers are <em>not</em> decimals. Trailing zeros
        do matter. 5.3.28 is greater than than 5.3.4. For more information please consult our

    <h4>Support policy</h4>

    <p>
        Items in green background are fully supported. Items in yellow background are
        still supported but we will be dropping support for that Joomla! / WordPress version soon; please upgrade your
        site. Everything else gets minimal support; we do <em>not</em> guarantee bug or security fixes for minimally
        supported items.
    </p>

    <h4>Important PHP version information</h4>

    <p>
        We only guarantee that we will support the PHP branches <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php">currently
        supported by the PHP project</a>. Support for earlier, end of life branches of PHP may be discontinued without
        warning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any PHP version older than a couple of months, even if it belongs to a supported branch, can be assumed out
        of date and vulnerable to security flaws. This also applies if your Linux distribution claims to backport
        security fixes;  they will <em>only</em> backport those marked as high impact, not <em>all</em> security fixes.
        Moreover, your Linux distribution will <em>never</em> backport bug fixes. Bugs in older PHP versions do cause
        software to behave erratically. Not just our software but also Joomla!, WordPress or anything else you might be
        using.
