COM_COMPATIBILITY="Version Compatibility"

COM_COMPATIBILITY_LBL_USEFUL_INFO="Useful information"

COM_COMPATIBILITY_LBL_INTRO_TOP="The following table tells you which version of our software is compatible with which combination of PHP and  Joomla! / WordPress. Click on the version number to download it."
COM_COMPATIBILITY_LBL_VERSIONNUMBER_NOTICE="<strong>Remember!</strong> Version numbers are <em>not</em> decimals. Trailing zeros do matter. 1.2.10 is greater than than 1.2.5. For more information please consult our <a href='%s'>How to read version numbers</a> page."

COM_COMPATIBILITY_HEAD_SUPPORT_POLICY="Support policy"
COM_COMPATIBILITY_LBL_SUPPORT_POLICY="Items in green background are fully supported. Items in dark grey background are  still supported but we will be dropping support for that Joomla! / WordPress version and PHP version combination soon; please upgrade your site. Everything else gets minimal support; we do <em>not</em> guarantee bug or security fixes for minimally supported items. For Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo in particular we do <em>not</em> guarantee that uploading to remote storage will work for minimally supported items."

COM_COMPATIBILITY_HEAD_PHP_VERSION_INFO="Important PHP version information"
COM_COMPATIBILITY_HEAD_LBL_PHP_VERSION_SUPPORTED="We only guarantee that we will support the PHP branches <a href='%s'>currently supported by the PHP project</a>. Support for earlier, end of life branches of PHP may be discontinued without warning."
COM_COMPATIBILITY_HEAD_LBL_PHP_VERSION_UPGRADENAG="Any PHP version older than a couple of months, even if it belongs to a supported branch, can be assumed out of date and vulnerable to security flaws. This also applies if your Linux distribution claims to backport security fixes;  they will <em>only</em> backport those marked as high impact, not <em>all</em> security fixes. Moreover, your Linux distribution will <em>never</em> backport bug fixes. Bugs in older PHP versions do cause software to behave erratically. Not just our software but also Joomla!, WordPress or anything else you might be using."
