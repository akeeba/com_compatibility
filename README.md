# Version Compatibility Page Generator

Generates a PHP and Joomla version compatibility matrix page.
 
This is an internal project for Akeeba Ltd's site. It goes through the Akeeba Release System records and figures out which
release of each component is compatible with which version of PHP and Joomla! / WordPress, generating the Compatibility
page automatically.

This version of the component requires Joomla 4 and uses core Joomla MVC and the core Bootstrap 5 styling to render itself.
